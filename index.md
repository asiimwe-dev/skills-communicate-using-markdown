# Understanding markdown in github and version control.
I am taking this course to understand how markdowns are used in github for documentation and version control.

## Key Take-Aways
- Markdowns are used in documentation to explain code.
- They are used to add formating to text files and show specific text formats.
- They are are also used to show code in documentations.
- They are also used in code reviews and pullrequests.

### Example of a project documentation using markdown
I started programming late last year in August and was introduced to two key programming languages. These were Python and C proogramming language.
These taught me the core values of programming such as variables, operators and so much more that I needed to know to start programming.
I wrote my first programs in both kanguages in that period and it qas a simple program that prints Hello, World!. These were as follows;
'''python
print("Hello, World!")
'''C
printf("Hello, world!")
