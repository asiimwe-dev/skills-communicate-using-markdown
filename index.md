# Understanding markdown in github and version control.
I am taking this course to understand how markdowns are used in github for documentation and version control.

## Key Take-Aways
- Markdowns are used in documentation to explain code.
- They are used to add formating to text files and show specific text formats.
- They are are also used to show code in documentations.
- They are also used in code reviews and pullrequests.

### Example of a project documentation using markdown
I started programming late last year in August and was introduced to two key programming languages. These were Python and C proogramming language.
These taught me the core values of programming such as variables, operators and so much more that I needed to know to start programming.
I wrote my first programs in both kanguages in that period and it qas a simple program that prints Hello, World!. These were as follows;
In python,
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
And in C
``` C
printf("Hello, World");
```


#### Images in markdown

#### Adding code blocks in markdown
This is a simple program in python that asks the user for their name and greats them.
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("What is your age? ")
print(f"Hello, {name} you are {age} years old.")
```
### Adding a checklist to a markdown
These are the skills that I should be knowing by now.
- [x] Python Programming
- [x] C Programming
- [ ] Git and Github
- [x] COA
- [x] Algorithms and Calculus
- [ ] Application of all the above
